{"id":"fredy-ch-z4i","title":"Research: Swiss housing cooperatives (Genossenschaften)","description":"Investigate feasibility of monitoring Swiss housing cooperatives (Wohnbaugenossenschaften) and municipal housing.\n\nWhy this matters:\n- Genossenschaften offer 20-30% CHEAPER rents than market\n- Municipal housing also often below market rate\n- Often overlooked by apartment hunters\n- Not on major portals\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL QUESTION: Model compatibility\nMost operate on WAITING LISTS, not real-time vacancy listings:\n- You register, wait months/years, then get offered something\n- This may NOT fit Fredy's 'alert on new listings' model\n- Research must determine if any post real-time vacancies\n\nBern cooperatives to investigate:\n- EBG Bern (ebgbern.ch) - 700+ units, largest in Bern\n- Pro Domo Bern (wbgprodomo.ch) - 345 units\n- Baugenossenschaft Berna - ~200 units\n- WOGENO Bern (wogeno-bern.ch)\n\nAlso check municipal housing:\n- Stadt Bern (bern.ch/themen/wohnen/mietobjekte) - city-owned housing\n\nQuestions to answer:\n1. Do they post real-time vacancies? Or just waiting list registration?\n2. How often do new listings appear?\n3. Is scraping feasible (simple HTML vs login-required)?\n4. Would alerts even help if waiting list is the model?\n\nLIKELY OUTCOME: May not be suitable for Fredy.
