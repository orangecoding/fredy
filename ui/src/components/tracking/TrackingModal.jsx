            <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>Fed up with popups? Yeah, me too. But this oneâ€™s important, and I promise it will only appear once ;)</p>
            <p>Fredy is completely free (and will always remain free). If youâ€™d like, you can support me by donating
                through my GitHub, but thereâ€™s absolutely no obligation to do so.</p>
            <p>However, it would be a huge
                help if youâ€™d allow me to collect some analytical data. Wait, before you click "no", let me explain. If
                you
                agree, Fredy will send a ping to my Mixpanel project each time it runs.</p>
            <p>The data includes: names of
                active adapters/providers, OS, architecture, Node version, and language. The information is entirely
                anonymous and helps me understand which adapters/providers are most frequently used.</p>
            <p>ThanksðŸ¤˜</p>
        </div>
    </Modal>;
