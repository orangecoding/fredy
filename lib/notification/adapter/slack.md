### Slack Adapter

 
In order to use [Slack](https://slack.com), you need to create an account. When done, you need to create a new App in your workspace. Give it the permission `chat:write:bot` and `chat:write:user`.  
 
Now you need to create a user token and a channel. Make sure the bot is installed to this channel.
