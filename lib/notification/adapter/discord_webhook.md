### Discord Adapter

To use the [Discord](https://discord.com/) Adapter, you need to create a webhook on the Discord channel of your choice. You can follow the instructions of _Making A Webhook_ on [this support website](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).
Once you have created a webhook, copy and paste the webhook URL.
