### Slack Adapter (Webhooks)

*IMPORTANT:*
This is the recommended Slack adapter. The old Slack adapter is unmaintained and kept only for backward compatibility.

Setup:
- Create a Slack account and workspace if you don't have one: https://slack.com
- Create a channel where you want to receive notifications.
- Add the Incoming Webhooks integration to that channel and copy the Webhook URL.
- In Fredy, configure the Slack Webhook adapter with this URL.
