### Slack Adapter

IMPORTANT:
This is the new version of the Slack adapter. I strongly encourage you to use it, the old version is now unmaintained and only kept due to backwards compatability reasons.

In order to use [Slack](https://slack.com), you need to create an account. When done, create a new channel and add the Webhook integration to that channel. Copy the webhook url. That's it.
