### Mailjet Adapter

To use [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com), create an account and decide which email address Fredy should send from.

For example, if you use yourGmailAccount@gmail.com, add and verify this address in Mailjet.
Provide your public/private API keys in Fredy's configuration. Fredy uses the same email template as for SendGrid.

To send to multiple recipients, separate email addresses with commas (e.g., some@email.com, someOther@email.com).
