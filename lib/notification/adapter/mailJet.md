### MailJet Adapter

To use [MailJet](https://mailjet.com), you need to create an account. You'll need to decide from which email address you want Fredy to send from.

E.g. if you use yourGmailAccount@gmail.com, you have to add this to MailJet and verify it as well.  
The given public/private api keys are needed in order to use MailJet with Fredy. Fredy will use the same template, it is using for SendGrid.

If this email should be sent to multiple receiver, use a comma separator (some@email.com, someOther@email.com).
