[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orangecoding/fredy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orangecoding/fredy)
  
My wife and I wanted to buy an apartment in germany. As the prices are quite high and good deals are very rare, we searched the "big 4" every morning.     
  
This however can get pretty frustrating. _Fredy_ will take this work away from you. It crawls the `provider`, mentioned below (Immonet, Immoscout...) every _x_ minutes. (The provider list can be extended easily...)     
  
If _Fredy_ found matching results, it will send them to you via Slack. (More adapter possible.) _Fredy_ is remembering what it already has found to not send stuff twice.  
  
## Usage  
  
- Make sure to use Node 11 and above  
- Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`  
- create your configuration file. Use the example config for this. `cp conf/config.example conf/config.json`  
- configure the desired values  
- start _Fredy_ using `npm start` or `yarn run start`  
  
## :point_up: Breaking Changes when updating from v1.x to v2
See [Upgrade Guide](./doc/upgrade-from-1-to-2.md)
  
## Configuration  
  
Before running _Fredy_ for the first time, you need to create a configuration file:  
  
Copy the example config as a start.  
```  
cp conf/config.example conf/config.json  
```  
  
### 1. Notification  
  
You want to get notified when _Fredy_ found a new listing. Currently _Fredy_ support Slack and Telegram to send notification. _Fredy_ also includes a notification adapter to print to the console instead of sending to a services.  
  
Adding new notification adapter is easy however. See [Contribution](https://github.com/orangecoding/fredy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)  
  
##### Slack 
```json  
"slack": {  
    "channel": "someChannel", 
    "token": "someToken", 
    "enabled": true
}  
```  
  
##### Telegram  
```json  
"telegram": {  
    "chatId": "someChannel", 
    "token": "someToken", 
    "enabled": true
}  
```  
  
For Telegram, you need to create a Bot. This is pretty easy. Open [this](https://telegram.me/BotFather) url on your smartphone and follow the instructions.  
A telegram bot is not allowed to send messages directly to a user, you as a user need to first contact the bot to get a chatId.     
After the user has send a message to your bot the first time, you can gather the chatId like this:   
```  
curl -X GET https://api.telegram.org/bot{YOUR_TELEGRAM_TOKEN}/getUpdates  
```  
  
A more detailed list of instructions can be found here [https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)

##### SendGrid 
```json  
"sendGrid": {
  "apiKey": "",
  "from": "",
  "receiver": "",
  "templateId": "",
  "enabled": true
}  
```    
If you don't use Slack, I'd personally recommend using Sendgrid or Mailjet. Both are free email service (free as in "you cannot send more than 100(Sendgrid) and 200(Mailjet) emails a day"), which is more than enough for Fredy.
   
To use [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), you need to create an account. You'll need to decided from which email address you want Fredy to send from. E.g. if you use yourGmailAccount@gmail.com, you have to add this to sendgrid and verify it as well.     
Lastly you have to create an api-key and feed it into Fredy's config, as well as creating a new template. For this new template, I recommend copying and pasting the one I provided under `/lib/notification/emailTemplate/template.hbs`.

##### MailJet 
```json  
"mailJet": {
  "apiPublicKey": "",
  "apiPrivateKey": "",
  "receiver": "",
  "from": "",
  "enabled": false
},
``` 
To use [MailJet](https://mailjet.com), you need to create an account. You'll need to decided from which email address you want Fredy to send from. E.g. if you use yourGmailAccount@gmail.com, you have to add this to MailJet and verify it as well.     
Feed the given piublic/private api key into Fredy's config and enable the adapter. Fredy will use the same template, it is using for SendGrid.

  
### 2. Multiple search jobs 

Since v2.0.0, Fredy supports multiple search jobs running within the same instance of Fredy. For this to work correctly, you need to give each search job a unique name.
See the example config... 
```json
(...)
 "jobs": {
    "yourSearchJob": {
      "some":"config"
    },
    "yourOtherSearchJob": {
     "some":"config"
    }
}
(...)
```  
  
### 3. Configure the providers  
  
Configure the providers like described below. To disable a provider just set to `enabled:false` within the config.  
  
#### Immoscout, Immonet and more  
  
These are the current provider that are already implemented within _Fredy_  
  
```json  
"kleinanzeigen": {  
 "url": "https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/...", "enabled": true}  
"immoscout": {  
 "url": "https://www.immobilienscout24.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"immowelt": {  
 "url": "https://www.immowelt.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"immonet": {  
 "url": "http://www.immonet.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"kalaydo": {  
 "url": "http://www.kalaydo.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"einsAImmobilien": {  
 "url": "https://www.1a-immobilienmarkt.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"neubauKompass": {  
 "url": "https://www.neubaukompass.de/...", "enabled": true},  
"wgGesucht": {  
 "url": "https://www.wg-gesucht.de/...", "enabled": true}  
```  
  
Go to the respective provider page and create your custom search queries by using the provided filter options. Then just copy and paste the whole URL of  
the resulting listings page.  
  
**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to always sort by newest listings! This way _Fredy_ makes sure to not accidentally report stuff twice.  
  
#### Custom provider  
  
See [Contribution](https://github.com/orangecoding/fredy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)  
  
### 4. Add Filters (optional)  
  
  
#### Blacklist  
  
```json  
"blacklist": [  
 "vermietet"
]  
```  
  
Listings which contain at least on of the given terms (ignoring case, only whole words) are removed.   
  
#### District blacklist  
```json  
"blacklistedDistricts": [  
 "Altstadt"
]  
```  
Districts that are unwanted can be blacklisted here.   
  
This makes sense for provider that only offer limited filter functions like Kalaydo/Ebay.  
  
# API   
While Fredy is running, you can make use of the rest api provided on port `9998` to get information about the current status of Fredy.    
You can disable the api by setting `infoApi: false` within the config.
  
#### http://localhost:9998/
Gives you an overview of running search jobs, their included enabled provider, last execution and the number of listings, found by each provider. 

#### http://localhost:9998/ping
Should you ever need some health checks, this returns pong ;)

#### http://localhost:9998/jobs/:name
Returns specific information about the job with the given name or `404` if the job could not be found.
